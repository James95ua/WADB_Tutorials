# Getting Started with GitHub

## Learning Outcomes

After reading this guide, you will understand what GitHub is and why it's valuable for web development. You will know the difference between Git and GitHub, understand basic GitHub terminology, and be prepared to create your own GitHub account. These fundamentals provide the foundation for using GitHub effectively to store code, collaborate, and publish websites.

## Prerequisites

No prior experience with version control or GitHub is required. You only need an email address to create a GitHub account and basic familiarity with using websites and web browsers.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting and collaboration tools for software development projects. At its core, GitHub stores code files in online repositories, which are organized collections of project files. GitHub builds on Git, which is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to see the history of your project and revert to previous versions if needed.

Understanding the relationship between Git and GitHub helps clarify their roles. Git is the version control software that developers use on their computers to track changes locally. Git operates through command-line tools and manages file history on your local machine. GitHub is a website service that hosts Git repositories online, providing a cloud-based location to store your code, share it with others, and access it from any computer with internet access. Think of Git as the engine that performs version control work, and GitHub as the service that hosts and enhances Git repositories with web-based features and collaboration tools.

GitHub matters for web development because it provides several important benefits that enhance your ability to create and share websites. First, GitHub serves as backup storage for your code. If your computer crashes or files become corrupted, your code remains safely stored on GitHub's servers. Second, GitHub makes it easy to share your projects with others, whether for collaboration, portfolio purposes, or getting feedback from peers or instructors. Third, GitHub provides free website hosting through GitHub Pages, allowing you to publish HTML and CSS websites online without paying for web hosting services. Fourth, using GitHub demonstrates professional development practices that employers and collaborators value, showing you understand industry-standard tools and workflows.

For learning web development, GitHub serves as both a practical tool and a learning opportunity. Storing your projects on GitHub creates a portfolio you can share with potential employers, instructors, or collaborators. The version history helps you see your progress over time and understand how your projects evolved. GitHub Pages provides free hosting for static websites, making it easy to publish your HTML and CSS projects and share them with others. Learning GitHub alongside HTML and CSS gives you a complete workflow for creating, storing, and sharing web projects.

## Key GitHub Concepts

Understanding a few key terms helps you navigate GitHub and use it effectively. A repository, often shortened to "repo," is a storage location for a project on GitHub. Each repository contains all the files for one project, along with the complete history of changes made to those files over time. Repositories can be either public or private. Public repositories are visible to anyone on the internet, while private repositories are only visible to you and people you specifically invite. For learning and portfolio projects, public repositories are common because they allow you to share your work and demonstrate your skills.

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. When you make changes to files and save those changes to GitHub, you create a commit that permanently records what changed, when it changed, and includes a message describing why the change was made. Commits are the building blocks of version control, allowing you to track your project's evolution and return to previous versions if needed. Each commit includes the files as they existed at that moment, creating a historical record of your project's development.

A branch is an independent line of development that allows you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. The main branch, typically called "main" or "master," represents the primary, stable version of your project. You can create additional branches to experiment with new features, try different approaches, or work on multiple tasks in parallel, all while keeping your main branch stable and functional. When you're ready, you can merge changes from branches back into the main branch.

These concepts work together to create a system for managing code that scales from simple personal projects to large collaborative efforts. Understanding repositories, commits, and branches provides the foundation for using GitHub effectively, whether you're working alone or collaborating with others.

## Creating Your GitHub Account

Creating a GitHub account is straightforward and free. The process requires only an email address and takes just a few minutes. Once you have an account, you can create unlimited repositories for your projects, whether they're private for personal use or public to share with others.

Visit github.com in your web browser. On the homepage, you'll see a sign-up form asking for a username, email address, and password. Choose a username carefully because it will be part of your GitHub profile URL and visible on all your projects. Many developers use their real name or a professional variation, while others create a unique handle that represents them online. Your username can be changed later, but it's better to choose something you'll want to keep long-term since changing it can break links to your repositories and requires updating references elsewhere.

Use an email address you check regularly, as GitHub will send important notifications about your repositories, security alerts, and collaboration requests to this address. You can add additional email addresses to your account later if needed. Choose a strong password following GitHub's requirements, which include minimum length and complexity rules. GitHub also supports two-factor authentication for additional security, which you can set up after creating your account.

After entering your information, GitHub will send a verification email to confirm your email address. Click the verification link in the email to activate your account. You may also be asked to verify you're human through a captcha. Once verified, you'll complete a brief setup process where GitHub asks about your experience level and interests. These questions help GitHub customize your experience, but your answers don't limit what you can do on the platform.

After account creation, take a moment to explore your profile page. This is where others will see your projects and contributions. You can add a profile picture, write a short bio describing your interests and skills, and link to your website or social media profiles. While optional, these details help establish your professional presence on GitHub, especially if you plan to use GitHub as part of a portfolio for job applications or academic submissions.

## Next Steps

Once you have a GitHub account, you're ready to create your first repository and start storing your HTML and CSS projects. The next guide, "Creating Your First Repository," walks through the process of setting up a repository and uploading your files. Having your code on GitHub opens possibilities for collaboration, backup storage, and eventually publishing websites using GitHub Pages.
