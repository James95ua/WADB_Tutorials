<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    Basic HTML Template
    
    This is a minimal HTML template to get you started.
    It includes the essential structure every HTML document needs.
    
    Key elements:
    - !DOCTYPE html: Declares this as an HTML5 document
    - html element: The root element wrapping all content
    - head section: Contains metadata about the page (not visible to users)
    - body section: Contains the visible content of the page
-->

<html lang="en">
<!-- 
    The lang attribute specifies the language of the page content.
    This helps screen readers and search engines understand your page.
    "en" indicates English - change this to match your content's language.
-->

<head>
    <!-- 
        The head section contains information about your page that isn't
        displayed directly on the page itself. This includes:
        - Character encoding
        - Page title (shown in browser tab)
        - Links to CSS files
        - Meta information
    -->
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- 
        This meta tag tells the browser which character encoding to use.
        UTF-8 supports most languages and special characters.
        This should always be the first element in the head section.
    -->
    
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- 
        This viewport meta tag is essential for responsive design.
        It ensures mobile devices render the page at the correct width.
        Without this, mobile browsers may display pages too small to read.
    -->
    
    <title>Basic HTML Template</title>
    <!-- 
        The title appears in the browser tab and in search engine results.
        Choose a descriptive title that tells users what the page is about.
    -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- 
        The body section contains all the visible content of your page.
        Everything you want users to see goes inside the body element.
    -->
    
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <!-- 
        h1 is the main heading of your page. You should have only one h1 per page.
        Headings help organize content and improve accessibility.
    -->
    
    <p>This is a paragraph of text. You can add multiple paragraphs to create your content.</p>
    <!-- 
        Paragraph tags wrap blocks of text content.
        Each paragraph should contain related sentences about one topic.
    -->
    
</body>
</html>
